# Data Mining Project - Analysis on Crypto Currency Market Cap
> Spring Semester March-June 2019, Yonsei University, Seoul, South Korea
> 
Project realized during the Data Mining course

Given the increased interest in Blockchain business, the need to learn about Blockchain is also increasing. Among the different Blockchain applications, our team is particularly interested in Ethereum, the second largest CryptoCurrency in the world. However, there is difficulty in predicting and analyzing the main factors which impact the capitalization of the Ethereum market.

Our team’s goal is to find some main factors and make it easy for those who are interested in Ethereum to understand and predict Ethereum in order to help facilitate their decision-making process. In order to achieve this goal, we can use the characteristic of transparent and immutable network of Ethereum by obtaining those network’s log data, like a transaction log. In short, by analyzing the Ethereum data, we can find main factor valuables, and using those valuables, we can predict a capitalization of each Ethereum market.
